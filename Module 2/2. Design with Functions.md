### Design with Functions

#### Functions as Abstraction Mechanisms
Functions in Python serve as abstraction mechanisms that allow you to encapsulate complex logic into reusable components. By defining functions, you can abstract away details and expose only the necessary interface, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

**Example:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# Using the functions
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8

result = multiply(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 15
```

#### Problem Solving with Top-Down Design
Top-down design is an approach where you break down a problem into smaller subproblems and solve each one independently. This method helps in managing complexity and improving code readability.

**Example:**
Suppose you need to calculate the average of a list of numbers. You can break this problem into smaller tasks: summing the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers.

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total_sum = sum_numbers(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    return total_sum / count

def sum_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total += number
    return total

# Using the functions
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print(average)  # Output: 3.0
```

#### Design with Recursive Functions
Recursive functions call themselves to solve smaller instances of the same problem. They are useful for tasks that can be defined in terms of similar subtasks.

**Example: Factorial of a Number**
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Using the function
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

#### Managing a Program’s Namespace
Namespaces in Python help in organizing the code and avoiding name conflicts. There are different types of namespaces, such as local, global, and built-in namespaces.

**Example:**
```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def func():
    x = 5  # Local variable
    print("Inside function:", x)

func()
print("Outside function:", x)

# Output:
# Inside function: 5
# Outside function: 10
```

To modify the global variable inside a function, you can use the `global` keyword:
```python
x = 10

def func():
    global x
    x = 5

func()
print("Outside function:", x)  # Output: 5
```

#### Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They are powerful tools for creating more abstract and reusable code.

**Example:**
```python
def apply_function(func, value):
    return func(value)

def square(x):
    return x * x

def cube(x):
    return x * x * x

# Using higher-order function
print(apply_function(square, 3))  # Output: 9
print(apply_function(cube, 3))    # Output: 27
```

#### Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are used for short, throwaway functions.

**Example:**
```python
# Lambda function to add two numbers
add = lambda a, b: a + b
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8

# Lambda function to square a number
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(4))  # Output: 16
```

#### Mapping
The `map()` function applies a given function to all items in an input list (or any iterable) and returns a map object (an iterator).

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * x, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

#### Filtering
The `filter()` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

#### Reducing
The `reduce()` function, from the `functools` module, applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list.

**Example:**
```python
from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)
print(sum_of_numbers)  # Output: 15
```

#### Example Programs

##### 1. Using Functions as Abstraction Mechanisms
**Example:**
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def farewell(name):
    return f"Goodbye, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))    # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(farewell("Bob"))   # Output: Goodbye, Bob!
```

##### 2. Problem Solving with Top-Down Design
**Example:**
```python
def main():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average is {average}")

def calculate_average(numbers):
    total_sum = sum_numbers(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    return total_sum / count

def sum_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total += number
    return total

main()
```

##### 3. Design with Recursive Functions
**Example: Fibonacci Sequence**
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Using the function
for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i), end=" ")  # Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

##### 4. Managing a Program’s Namespace
**Example:**
```python
x = "global"

def outer():
    x = "outer local"

    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = "inner local"
        print("inner:", x)

    inner()
    print("outer:", x)

outer()
print("global:", x)

# Output:
# inner: inner local
# outer: inner local
# global: global
```

##### 5. Higher-Order Functions
**Example: Using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` Functions**
```python
# Using map to apply a function to all elements in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * x, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Using filter to select elements that satisfy a condition
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]

# Using reduce to accumulate values
from functools import reduce
sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)
print(sum_of_numbers)  # Output: 15
```

These notes and examples cover essential aspects of designing with functions in Python, providing a solid foundation for using functions as abstraction mechanisms, problem-solving with top-down design, designing recursive functions, managing namespaces, and leveraging higher-order functions, lambda functions, mapping, filtering, and reducing.
