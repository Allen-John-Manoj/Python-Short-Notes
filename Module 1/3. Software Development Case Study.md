# The Software Development Process

The process of planning and organizing a program is called the **software development process**. There are several approaches to software development. One version is known as the **waterfall model**.

## Waterfall Model Phases

The waterfall model consists of several phases:

1. **Customer Request**
   - In this phase, the programmers receive a broad statement of a problem. 
   - This step is also called the user requirements phase.

2. **Analysis**
   - The programmers determine what the program will do.
   - This is sometimes viewed as a process of clarifying the specifications for the problem.

3. **Design**
   - The programmers determine how the program will do its task.

4. **Implementation**
   - The programmers write the program.
   - This step is also called the coding phase.

5. **Integration**
   - Large programs have many parts.
   - In the integration phase, these parts are brought together into a smoothly functioning whole, usually not an easy task.

6. **Maintenance**
   - Programs usually have a long life; a lifespan of 5 to 15 years is common for software.
   - During this time, requirements change, errors are detected, and minor or major modifications are made.

- The figure resembles a waterfall, in which the results of each phase flow down to the next.
- However, a mistake detected in one phase often requires the developer to back up and redo some of the work in the previous phase. Modifications made during maintenance also require backing up to earlier phases. Taken together, these phases are also called the **software development life cycle**.
- Modern software development is usually **incremental and iterative**. This means that analysis and design may produce a rough draft, skeletal version, or prototype of a system for coding, and then back up to earlier phases to fill in more details after some testing.
- Keep in mind that mistakes found early are much less expensive to correct than those found late. These are not just financial costs but also costs in time and effort.

## Additional Notes

- The waterfall model is linear and sequential, making it easy to understand and manage.
- It is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements.
- However, it lacks flexibility, making it less suitable for projects where requirements may change frequently.
