# Graphical User Interfaces

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Displays text/icons
- Commands activated by pressing the enter key or control keys
  1. A GUI program is event-driven
  2. Inactive until user interacts with GUI components
  3. Enter inputs in any order
  4. Running different data sets does not require re-entering all of the data

## Terminal Based Program
1. A terminal-based program maintains constant control over the interactions with the user.
2. Prompts users to enter successive inputs.
3. The user is constrained to reply to a definite sequence of prompts for inputs.
4. Once an input is entered, there is no way to back up and change it.
5. To obtain results for a different set of input data, the user must run the program again.
6. At that point, all of the inputs must be re-entered.

## Event-Driven Programming
- Type of programming used to create user-generated events (mouse clicks, pulling in inputs) processing them, displaying results is called event-driven programming.
- GUI-based programs are almost always object-based.
  1. Define a new class to represent the main application window.
  2. Instantiate the classes of window components such as labels, fields, and command buttons.
  3. Position components in the window.
  4. Register a method with each window component in which an event relevant to the application might occur.
  5. Define methods to handle the events.
  6. Define a main function that instantiates the window class and runs it.

### Coding Simple GUI-Based Programs
- Python’s standard tkinter module includes classes for windows and numerous types of window components.


### Windows and Window Components

#### Windows and Their Attributes
- A window has several attributes.
  1. title (an empty string by default)
  2. width and height in pixels
  3. resizability (true by default)
  4. background color (white by default)

```python
EasyFrame.__init__(self, width = 300, height = 200, title = "Label Demo")
```

- Override window’s default title, an empty string, by supplying another string as an optional title argument to the EasyFrame method __init__.

```python
self["background"] = "yellow"
```

- The window’s background color can be set to yellow.

#### EasyFrame Method Table

| EasyFrame Method          | What It Does                                   |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| setBackground(color)      | Sets the window’s background color to color.   |
| setResizable(aBoolean)    | Makes the window resizable (True) or not (False). |
| setSize(width, height)    | Sets the window’s width and height in pixels.  |
| setTitle(title)           | Sets the window’s title to title.              |

### Window Layout
- Window components are laid out in the window’s two-dimensional grid.
- The grid’s rows and columns are numbered from the position (0, 0) in the upper-left corner of the window.
- A window component’s row and column position in the grid is specified when the component is added to the window.
- Can override the default alignment by including the sticky attribute as a keyword argument when the label is added to the window.
- The values of sticky are the strings “N,” “S,” “E,” and “W,” or any combination thereof.
- Labels retain their alignments in the exact center of their grid positions.
- Window layout involves the spanning of a window component across several grid positions.
- The programmer can force a horizontal and/or vertical spanning of grid positions by supplying the rowspan and columnspan keyword arguments when adding a component.

### Types of Window Components and Their Attributes
- GUI programs use several types of window components, or widgets, as they are commonly called.
- These include labels, entry fields, text areas, command buttons, drop-down menus, sliding scales, scrolling list boxes, canvases, and many others.

```python
self.addComponentType(<arguments>)
```

- Creates an instance of the requested type of window component.
- Initializes the component’s attributes with default values or any values provided by the programmer.
- Places the component in its grid position (the row and column are required arguments).
- Returns a reference to the component.

### Table of Window Components

| Type of Window Component | Purpose                                                           |

### Displaying Images
- One label displays the image and the other label displays the caption.

| Label Attribute | Type of Value                                                                                     |

```python
from breezypythongui import EasyFrame
from tkinter import PhotoImage
from tkinter.font import Font

class ImageDemo(EasyFrame):
    """Displays an image and a caption."""

    def __init__(self):
        """Sets up the window and the widgets."""
        EasyFrame.__init__(self, title = "Image Demo")
        self.setResizable(False)
        self.imageLabel = self.addLabel(text = "", row = 0, column = 0, sticky = "NSEW")
        textLabel = self.addLabel(text = "Smokey the cat", row = 1, column = 0, sticky = "NSEW")

        # Load the image and associate it with the image label.
        self.image = PhotoImage(file = "smokey.gif")
        self.imageLabel["image"] = self.image

        # Set the font and color of the caption.
        font = Font(family = "Verdana", size = 20, slant = "italic")
        textLabel["font"] = font
        textLabel["foreground"] = "blue"
```

### Command Buttons and Responding to Events

```python
class ButtonDemo(EasyFrame):
    """Illustrates command buttons and user events."""

    def __init__(self):
        """Sets up the window, label, and buttons."""
        EasyFrame.__init__(self)
        # A single label in the first row.
        self.label = self.addLabel(text = "Hello world!", row = 0, column = 0, columnspan = 2, sticky = "NSEW")

        # Two command buttons in the second row.
        self.clearBtn = self.addButton(text = "Clear", row = 1, column = 0, command = self.clear)
        self.restoreBtn = self.addButton(text = "Restore", row = 1, column = 1, command = self.restore, state = "disabled")

    # Methods to handle user events.
    def clear(self):
        self.label["text"] = ""
        self.clearBtn["state"] = "disabled"
        self.restoreBtn["state"] = "normal"

    def restore(self):
        self.label["text"] = "Hello world!"
        self.clearBtn["state"] = "normal"
        self.restoreBtn["state"] = "disabled"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ButtonDemo().mainloop()
```
- A command button can be added to a window by specifying its text and position in the grid.
- A button is centered in its grid position by default.
- The method `addButton` accomplishes all this and returns an object of type `tkinter.Button`.
- Button can display an image instead of a string.
- A button also has a state attribute, which can be set to “normal” to enable the button (its default state) or “disabled” to disable it.

### Input and Output with Entry Fields
- An entry field is a box in which the user can position the mouse cursor and enter a number or a single line of text.

#### Text Fields
- A text field is appropriate for entering or displaying a single-line string of characters.
- The method `addTextField` is used to add a text field to a window.
- The method returns an object of type `TextField`, which is a subclass of `tkinter.Entry`.
- Required arguments to `addTextField` are `text` (the string to be initially displayed), `row`, and `column`.
- Optional arguments are `rowspan`, `columnspan`, `sticky`, `width`, and `state`.

- A text field is aligned by default to the northeast of its grid cell.
- A text field has a default width of 20 characters.
- This represents the maximum number of characters viewable in the box, but the user can continue typing or viewing them by moving the cursor key to the right.
- The programmer can set a text field’s state attribute to “readonly” to prevent the user from editing an output field.
- The `TextField` method `getText` returns the string currently contained in a text field.
- The method `setText` outputs its string argument to a text field.

| Field Type  | Method               | What it does                                     |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| IntegerField, FloatField | `getNumber()`         |    Returns (as input) the number contained in the field. |
|     IntegerField, FloatField                      |   `setNumber(number)` | Outputs the number to the field.      |                
| FloatField  | `setPrecision(width)`| Sets the number of digits to display to right of the decimal point. |
| TextField   | `getText()`          | Returns (as input) the string contained in the field. |
| TextField             | `setText(text)`      | Outputs the string to the field.                  |

### Using Pop-Up Message Boxes
- When errors arise in a GUI-based program, the program often responds by popping up a dialog window with an error message.
- The program detects the error, pops up the dialog to inform the user, and, when the user closes the dialog, continues to accept and check input data.
- In a terminal-based program, this process usually requires an explicit loop structure.
- In a GUI-based program, Python’s implicit event-driven loop continues the process automatically.

---

### Python’s try-except statement

```python
try:
    <statements that might raise an exception>
except <exception type>:
    <statements to recover from the exception>
```

- If an exception is raised anywhere in this process, control shifts immediately to the except clause.

```python
# The event handling method for the button
def computeSqrt(self):
    """Inputs the integer, computes the square root, and outputs the result. Handles input errors by displaying a message box."""
    try:
        number = self.inputField.getNumber()
        result = math.sqrt(number)
        self.outputField.setNumber(result)
    except ValueError:
        self.messageBox(title = "ERROR", message = "Input must be an integer >= 0")
```
