### Exceptions in Python

#### Errors and Exceptions
- **Syntax Errors**: These occur when you type the code incorrectly. They are detected during the parsing of the code before execution.
- **Exceptions**: These occur during the execution of a program when something unexpected happens. They are different from syntax errors.

#### Common Built-in Exceptions
- **NameError**: Raised when the program cannot find a local or global name. The name that could not be found is included in the error message.
- **TypeError**: Raised when a function is passed an object of the inappropriate type as its argument. More details about the wrong type are provided in the error message.
- **ValueError**: Occurs when a function argument has the right type but an inappropriate value.
- **NotImplementedError**: Raised when an object is supposed to support an operation but it has not been implemented yet. This error should not be used when the given function is not meant to support the type of input argument. In those situations, raising a `TypeError` exception is more appropriate.
- **ZeroDivisionError**: Raised when you provide the second argument for a division or modulo operation as zero.
- **FileNotFoundError**: Raised when the file or directory that the program requested does not exist.

### Handling Exceptions

#### Handling a Single Exception
- **Example**: Handling `ValueError` when a non-integer input is provided.
  ```python
  a = True
  while a:
      try:
          x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
          print("Dividing 50 by", x, "will give you:", 50/x)
      except ValueError:
          print("The input was not an integer. Please try again...")
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  Please enter a number: a
  The input was not an integer. Please try again...
  Please enter a number: 2
  Dividing 50 by 2 will give you: 25.0
  ```
  **Explanation**:
  - If no exception is raised, the program skips the `except` clause and the rest of the code executes normally.
  - If an exception is raised, the program skips the remaining code inside the `try` clause and the type of the exception is matched with the name of the exception after the `except` keyword.
  - In case of a match, the code inside the `except` clause is executed first, and then the rest of the code after the `try` clause is executed normally.
  - When you enter an integer as an input, the program gives you the final result of the division.
  - When a non-integral value is provided, the program prints a message asking you to try and enter an integer again.
  - Note that this time, the program does not abruptly quit when you provide some invalid input.

#### Handling Multiple Exceptions
- **Example**: Handling multiple exceptions (`ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`, `TypeError`) using a single `except` clause by passing these exceptions to the clause as a tuple.
  ```python
  a = True
  while a:
      try:
          x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
          print("Dividing 50 by", x, "will give you:", 50/x)
      except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, TypeError):
          print("Something has gone wrong...")
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  Please enter a number: 0
  Something has gone wrong...
  Please enter a number: a
  Something has gone wrong...
  ```

- **Catching all exceptions**: Properly print out the exception error on the screen.
  ```python
  import math
  import sys

  try:
      result = math.factorial(2.4)
  except:
      print("Something Unexpected has happened.")
  else:
      print("The factorial is", result)
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  Something Unexpected has happened.
  ```

#### Using the Else Clause
- The else clause is meant to contain code that needs to be executed if the try clause did not raise any exceptions.
- Example:
  ```python
  a = True
  while a:
      try:
          x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
      except ValueError:
          print("The input was not a valid integer. Please try again...")
      else:
          print("Dividing 50 by", x, "will give you:", 50 / x)
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  Please enter a number: 2
  Dividing 50 by 2 will give you: 25.0
  ```

#### Using the Finally Clause
- The code inside the finally clause is always executed irrespective of whether the try block raised an exception.
- Example:
  ```python
  a = True
  while a:
      try:
          x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
      except ValueError:
          print("The input was not a valid integer. Please try again...")
      else:
          print("Dividing 50 by", x, "will give you:", 50/x)
      finally:
          print("Already did everything necessary.")
  ```
  **Output**:
  ```
  Please enter a number: 2
  Dividing 50 by 2 will give you: 25.0
  Already did everything necessary.
  Please enter a number: d
  The input was not a valid integer. Please try again...
  Already did everything necessary.
  ```

#### Raising Exceptions
- An exception can be raised forcefully by using the `raise` clause in Python. It is useful in scenarios where we need to stop the execution of the program.
  - **Syntax**: `raise Exception_class, <value>`
  - Example:
    ```python
    try:
        age = int(input("Enter the age: "))
        if age < 18:
            raise ValueError
        else:
            print("The age is valid")
    except ValueError:
        print("The age is not valid")
    ```
    **Output**:
    ```
    Enter the age: 16
    The age is not valid
    ```

#### User-Defined Exceptions
- Users can define custom exceptions by creating a new class derived from the built-in `Exception` class.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    class CustomError(Exception):
        def __init__(self, message):
            self.message = message
            super().__init__(self.message)

    try:
        raise CustomError("This is a custom error message")
    except CustomError as e:
        print(e)
    ```
    **Output**:
    ```
    This is a custom error message
    ```
