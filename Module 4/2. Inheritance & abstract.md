### Structuring Classes with Inheritance and Polymorphism

#### Inheritance in Python
- **Inheritance**: An important aspect of the object-oriented paradigm. It provides code reusability to the program because we can use an existing class to create a new class instead of creating it from scratch. The child class acquires the properties and can access all the data members and functions defined in the parent class. A child class can also provide its specific implementation to the functions of the parent class.
  - **Syntax**: 
    ```python
    class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
        <class-suite>
    ```
  - **Types of Inheritance**:
    - **Single Inheritance**: When a child class inherits from only one parent class.
      ```python
      class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
          <class-suite>
      ```
    - **Multiple Inheritance**: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
      ```python
      class DerivedClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2, ...):
          <class-suite>
      ```
      **Example**:
      ```python
      class Person:
          def __init__(self, name, age):
              self.name = name
              self.age = age

          def showName(self):
              print(self.name)

          def showAge(self):
              print(self.age)

      class Student:
          def __init__(self, rollno):
              self.rollno = rollno

          def getRollno(self):
              print(self.rollno)

      class Resident(Person, Student):
          def __init__(self, name, age, rollno):
              Person.__init__(self, name, age)
              Student.__init__(self, rollno)

      r = Resident("Roshan", 21, 101)
      r.showName()
      r.showAge()
      r.getRollno()
      ```
    - **Multilevel Inheritance**: When a derived class inherits another derived class.
      ```python
      class Class1:
          <class-suite>

      class Class2(Class1):
          <class-suite>

      class Class3(Class2):
          <class-suite>
      ```
      **Example**:
      ```python
      class First:
          def first(self):
              print("I am the first class")

      class Second(First):
          def second(self):
              print("I am the second class")

      class Third(Second):
          def third(self):
              print("I am the third class")

      t = Third()
      t.first()
      t.second()
      t.third()
      ```
      **Conflict Resolution in Multilevel Inheritance**:
      - **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: Python follows a specific order to resolve methods when dealing with multiple inheritances. MRO is based on the C3 linearization algorithm, which is depth-first, left-to-right.
      ```python
      class A:
          def method(self):
              print("Method in A")

      class B(A):
          def method(self):
              print("Method in B")

      class C(A):
          def method(self):
              print("Method in C")

      class D(B, C):
          pass

      d = D()
      d.method()
      ```
      Output: `Method in B`
      
      In this example, the `method` in class `B` is called because the MRO for class `D` is `D -> B -> C -> A`.

    - **Hierarchical Inheritance**: When more than one derived class is created from a single base class.
      ```python
      class Class1:
          <class-suite>

      class Class2(Class1):
          <class-suite>

      class Class3(Class1):
          <class-suite>
      ```
    - **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of more than one type of inheritance.

- **Super() Function**: The `super()` function in Python is used to call a method from the parent class. It allows you to avoid using the base class name explicitly, making it easier to work with multiple inheritance.
  ```python
  class Person:
      def __init__(self, fname, lname):
          self.firstname = fname
          self.lastname = lname

      def printname(self):
          print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

  class Student(Person):
      def __init__(self, fname, lname):
          super().__init__(fname, lname)

  x = Student("John", "Samuel")
  x.printname()  # Output: John Samuel
  ```

#### Polymorphism in Python
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on many forms. It refers to the use of a single type entity (method, operator, or object) to represent different types in different scenarios.
  - **Operator Overloading**: An operator is used in different ways for different data types.
    ```python
    num1 = 1
    num2 = 2
    print(num1 + num2)  # Output: 3

    str1 = "Python"
    str2 = "Programming"
    print(str1 + " " + str2)  # Output: Python Programming
    ```
  - **Method Overloading**: A class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
    ```python
    class Area:
        def find_area(self, a=None, b=None):
            if a is not None and b is not None:
                print("Rectangle:", a * b)
            elif a is not None:
                print("Square:", a * a)
            else:
                print("No figure assigned")

    obj1 = Area()
    obj1.find_area()
    obj1.find_area(10)
    obj1.find_area(10, 20)
    ```

  - **Method Overriding**: A child class redefines methods of its parent class to provide specific implementation.
    - **Conditions for Overriding**:
      - The method must have the same name as in the parent class.
      - The method must have the same number of parameters.
      - The method must be in the child class.
    ```python
    class Parent:
        def __init__(self):
            self.value = "Inside Parent"

        def show(self):
            print(self.value)

    class Child(Parent):
        def __init__(self):
            self.value = "Inside Child"

        def show(self):
            print(self.value)

    obj1 = Parent()
    obj2 = Child()
    obj1.show()  # Output: Inside Parent
    obj2.show()  # Output: Inside Child
    ```

#### Abstract Classes in Python
- **Abstract Class**: A class that contains one or more abstract methods. Abstract methods are methods that are declared, but contain no implementation. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and are typically used as a blueprint for other classes.
  - **Creating an Abstract Class**:
    ```python
    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

    class MyClass(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def mymethod(self):
            pass
    ```
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

    class Parent(ABC):
        def common(self):
            print("I am the common of parent")

        @abstractmethod
        def vary(self):
            pass

    class Child1(Parent):
        def vary(self):
            print("I am vary of child1")

    class Child2(Parent):
        def vary(self):
            print("I am vary method of child2")

    obj1 = Child1()
    obj1.common()
    obj1.vary()
    obj2 = Child2()
    obj2.common()
    obj2.vary()
    ```
  - **Important Points**:
    - An abstract class can have both concrete methods and abstract methods.
    - An abstract class works as a template for other classes.
    - An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
    - Generally, abstract methods defined in abstract classes do not have bodies.
    - If any abstract method is not implemented by the derived class, Python throws an error.
