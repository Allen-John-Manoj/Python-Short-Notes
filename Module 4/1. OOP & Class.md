### Object-Oriented vs. Procedure-Oriented Programming
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Focuses on objects that contain data and methods. Promotes code reuse through inheritance and encapsulation.
- **Procedure-Oriented Programming**: Focuses on functions or procedures to operate on data. More linear and less modular compared to OOP.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) vs. Procedural Programming

| Feature                  | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)                  | Procedural Programming                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Unit of Program**    | **Object**: The basic unit of OOP is an object. An object is an instance of a class and encapsulates both data and behaviors (methods). | **Function**: The basic unit of procedural programming is the function. Functions contain a sequence of computational steps or instructions to perform tasks. |
| **Approach**                 | **Bottom-up**: OOP follows a bottom-up approach. It starts with creating objects that interact with each other to build complex systems. | **Top-down**: Procedural programming follows a top-down approach. It begins by designing the high-level functions and breaking them down into smaller sub-functions. |
| **Focus**                    | **Data**: OOP focuses on data and the methods that operate on that data. The emphasis is on objects that represent real-world entities. | **Functions**: Procedural programming focuses on writing functions or procedures that operate on data. The emphasis is on the sequence of actions to be performed. |
| **Data Access**              | **Through Methods**: In OOP, data is accessed and manipulated through methods, ensuring data encapsulation and protection. | **Global Data Access**: In procedural programming, data can be accessed globally, making it less secure and more prone to unintended modifications. |
| **Code Reusability**         | **High**: OOP promotes code reuse through inheritance (where a new class inherits properties from an existing class) and polymorphism (where methods can perform different tasks based on the object calling them). | **Limited**: Procedural programming has limited code reuse capabilities. Functions can be reused, but there is no inherent mechanism like inheritance or polymorphism. |
| **Data Security**            | **High**: OOP provides data hiding through encapsulation. Private data cannot be accessed directly from outside the object, enhancing security. | **Low**: Procedural programming does not provide a robust mechanism for data hiding. Data is often globally accessible, making it less secure. |
| **Problem-Solving Approach** | **Object-Oriented**: OOP is used where computation is done by using objects. It simulates the real-world entities and problems, making the development and maintenance easier. Real-world problems can be easily solved through OOP. | **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Procedural programming uses a list of instructions to do computation step-by-step. It doesn't simulate the real world and works on step-by-step instructions divided into small parts called functions. |
| **Development and Maintenance** | **Easier**: OOP makes the development and maintenance of complex systems easier through modular design, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. | **Challenging**: In procedural programming, maintaining codes becomes difficult as projects grow in size and complexity. It lacks the modularity and abstraction provided by OOP. |
| **Examples**                  | **Languages**: C++, Java, .NET, Python, C#, etc. | **Languages**: C, Fortran, Pascal, VB, etc. |



#### Objects and Classes
- **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. A class is a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions).
- **Class**: The basic structure for an object. Defined by the user and provides the blueprint for objects.
  - **Data Member**: A variable defined in a class or an object. Holds the data associated with it.
  - **Instance Variable**: Defined within a method and specific to the object instance.
  - **Class Variable**: Defined in the class and can be used by all instances of the class.
  - **Instance**: An object of a class.
  - **Instantiation**: The process of creating an object of a class.
  - **Method**: Functions defined in the class definition and used by various instances of the class.
  - **Function Overloading**: Defining multiple functions with the same name but different behaviors.
  - **Inheritance**: A class can inherit attributes and methods from another class, known as a derived class. Promotes code reuse.
  - **Polymorphism**: The ability of objects to take on many forms, responding differently to the same action.

#### Data Encapsulation
- Restrictions on access to methods and variables to prevent accidental modification. Known as encapsulation.

#### Class Definition
- A class is defined using the `class` keyword.
  ```python
  class Student:
      '''Student details'''
      def fill_details(self, name, branch, year):
          self.name = name
          self.branch = branch
          self.year = year
          print("A student detail object is created...")

      def print_details(self):
          print("Name:", self.name)
          print("Branch:", self.branch)
          print("Year:", self.year)
  ```
- Creating objects of a class:
  ```python
  s1 = Student()
  s2 = Student()
  s1.fill_details('Rahul', 'CSE', '2020')
  s1.print_details()
  s2.fill_details('Akhil', 'ECE', '2010')
  s2.print_details()
  ```

#### Constructors in Python
- **Constructor**: A special method used to initialize the instance members of the class.
  - **Parameterized Constructor**: Accepts parameters.
    ```python
    class ComplexNumber:
        def __init__(self, r=0, i=0):
            self.real = r
            self.imag = i

        def getNumber(self):
            print(f'{self.real} + j{self.imag}')
    num1 = ComplexNumber(2, 3)
    num1.getNumber()
    ```
  - **Non-parameterized Constructor**: Does not accept parameters.
    ```python
    class Student:
        def __init__(self):
            print("This is a non-parameterized constructor")

        def show(self, name):
            print("Hello", name)
    s1 = Student()
    s1.show("Roshan")
    ```

#### Accessors and Mutators
- **Accessor Method**: Used to access the state of the object without modifying it. Prefixed with `get`.
- **Mutator Method**: Used to modify the state of the object. Prefixed with `set`.
  ```python
  class Fruit:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name

      def setFruitName(self, name):
          self.name = name

      def getFruitName(self):
          return self.name

  f1 = Fruit("Apple")
  print("First fruit name:", f1.getFruitName())
  f1.setFruitName("Grape")
  print("Second fruit name:", f1.getFruitName())
  ```
